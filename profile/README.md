**Outliers Analytics** is a data science organization focused on applying electoral and socio-demographic data to build data-driven strategies for elections. Our mission is to turn public data into actionable insight through rigorous analysis, modeling, and visualization.

In parallel with our applied work, we also develop and release open-source statistical tools for Python, aimed at making data science workflows cleaner, faster, and more effective.

## ðŸ§° Open-Source Tools

### ðŸ“Š [Cellmate](https://github.com/OutliersAnalytics/cellmate)

**Cellmate** is a lightweight Python package for creating and managing styled Excel spreadsheets using [OpenPyXL](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/).  
It simplifies the process of generating reports with features like:

- Table formatting with headers and borders  
- Cell-level styling (alignment, font, number format, etc.)  
- Reusable components for programmatic report generation  
- Seamless integration into Python data pipelines

Ideal for data scientists and analysts who need to export structured reports directly from code.

More open-source statistical tools are in development and will be released here as they mature.
